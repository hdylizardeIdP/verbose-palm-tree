# - All versions pinned with == to prevent automatic updates
# - Verify each update before deploying to production
# - Run 'pip-audit' before updating: pip install pip-audit && pip-audit
# - Check for CVEs: https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database
#
# To update safely:
# 1. Check for vulnerabilities: pip-audit -r requirements.txt
# 2. Review changelogs for each package
# 3. Test in development environment
# 4. Update one package at a time
# 5. Run full test suite after each update
#
# For additional security, generate hashes:
# pip-compile --generate-hashes requirements.in
